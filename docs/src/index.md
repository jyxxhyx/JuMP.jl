!!! warning
    Between versions 0.18 and 0.19, JuMP underwent a major transition in its
    underlying solver abstraction API, from
    [MathProgBase](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl) to
    [MathOptInterface](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl).
    See [NEWS.md](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/blob/master/NEWS.md) for
    a comprehensive list of changes between the two versions, many of which
    are breaking. This documentation is for JuMP/MathOptInterface.
    For the documentation of JuMP 0.18, see
    [here](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/0.18/).

## What is JuMP?

[JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) is a domain-specific modeling
language for [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization)
embedded in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). It currently supports a number of
open-source and commercial solvers for a variety of problem classes, including
linear, mixed-integer, second-order conic, semidefinite, and nonlinear
programming.

## Resources for getting started

* Checkout the [Installation Guide](@ref).
* Read the introductory tutorials [Getting started with Julia](@ref) and
  [Getting started with JuMP](@ref).
* Browse some of our examples, including classics such as [The diet problem](@ref),
  or the [Maximum likelihood estimation](@ref) problem using nonlinear
  programming.
* Work through more in-depth tutorials at [JuMPTutorials.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMPTutorials.jl)
* Join the [community forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/opt/13) to
  search for questions to commonly asked questions.
  - Before asking a question, make sure to read [PSA: make it easier to help you](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/psa-make-it-easier-to-help-you/14757),
    which contains a number of tips on how to ask a good question.

## Key features

JuMP's features include:

-   User friendliness
    -   Syntax that mimics natural mathematical expressions.
    -   Complete documentation (WIP!)
-   Speed
    -   Benchmarking has shown that JuMP can create problems at similar speeds
        to special-purpose modeling languages such as
        [AMPL](https://ampl.com/).
    -   JuMP communicates with most solvers in memory, avoiding the need to
        write intermediary files.
-   Solver independence
    -   JuMP uses a generic solver-independent interface provided by the
        [MathOptInterface](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl)
        package, making it easy to change between a number of open-source and
        commercial optimization software packages ("solvers"). The [Supported solvers](@ref)
        section contains a table of the currently supported solvers.
-   Access to advanced algorithmic techniques
    -   Including efficient LP re-solves which previously required using
        solver-specific and/or low-level C++ libraries.
-   Ease of embedding
    -   JuMP itself is written purely in Julia. Solvers are the only binary
        dependencies.
    -   Being embedded in a general-purpose programming language makes it easy
        to solve optimization problems as part of a larger workflow (e.g.,
        inside a simulation, behind a web server, or as a subproblem in a
        decomposition algorithm).
        -   As a trade-off, JuMP's syntax is constrained by the syntax available
            in Julia.
    -   JuMP is [MPL](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/) licensed, meaning that
        it can be embedded in commercial software that complies with the terms
        of the license.
